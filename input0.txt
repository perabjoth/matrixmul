Note: We need to follow the format of this input file for other possible input files. 
Two matrices are separated by an empty line.
Each matric element is separated by comma ','.
Each elements are real numbers.

N= size of the elements of the final matrix. 
Since here the matrices are 3x4 and 4x5, thus the final will be 3 x 5.
   Therefore, N = 15.
